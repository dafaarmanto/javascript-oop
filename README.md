Don't forget to change the JS file in the `index.html` file, and open the file in your browser. Or using VSCode, install Live Server extensions, run the server, and open the URL in the browser.

```
<script src="./src/file_name.js"></script>
```

Or, you can use `Node.js`, if it's installed on your machine, and simply type in terminal:

```
# In Windows, use PowerShell, Git Bash, or CMD

node .\src\file_name.js

# In Mac OS or Linux, you can use your terminal

node ./src/file_name.js
```
